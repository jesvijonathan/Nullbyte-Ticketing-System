    "analysis": "The reported slowness of WLPFO on node 1 is impacting user logins.  Possible causes include high CPU/memory usage, network latency, database issues, or problems with the WLPFO application itself on that specific node.  Troubleshooting steps would involve checking server resource utilization, network connectivity between users and node 1, database performance, and WLPFO logs for errors.  A deeper analysis of the WLPFO application's performance on node 1 is necessary to pinpoint the root cause.",

    "enhance": "WLPFO is experiencing significant performance issues on node 1, resulting in users being unable to log in.  This high-priority issue requires immediate attention.  Initial investigation points towards potential bottlenecks on node 1, including resource constraints (CPU/Memory), network latency, or database performance issues.  We are actively investigating WLPFO logs and server metrics to isolate the root cause and implement a fix.  We will provide further updates as they become available.  In the meantime, please refrain from any non-essential operations on node 1.",
