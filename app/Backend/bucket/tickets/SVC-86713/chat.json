I see you are having an issue logging in. Can you please describe the issue you are facing? Also, I see an attachment. Let me analyze it.\n\nOkay, from the logs, I see the following:\n\n* Application started successfully.\n* User 'wl2028' logged in.\n* Training Manager initialized and invoked multiple times.\n* Course menus and instances were created and deleted multiple times.\n* Employee menus and enrollments were created, selected, and deleted.\n* Database reset occurred.\n* Application exited.\n* Subsequent login attempts resulted in \"Invalid username or password\" errors.\n\nIt seems like the database reset might be related to the login issue.  Could you please confirm if you are still facing the login issue after the database reset?  If so, are you using the correct username and password after the reset?\n\nType 'create' to create a ticket or 'status' to check the current status."}, "4": {"recipient": "admin", "time": "2024-10-09T21:54:14.041282", "message": "/create"}, "5": {"recipient": "wl_vertex", "time": "2024-10-09T21:54:24.552585", "message": "Thank you for providing the logs and screenshot.
