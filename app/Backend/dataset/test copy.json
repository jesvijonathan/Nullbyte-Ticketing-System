    "summary": "Transactions processed through WLPFO are being declined when the P025 field is set to 28, while transactions with P025 value 00 are approved.  The attached transaction logs show errors like \"[ERROR]: P025 invalid\" when P025 is 28.  The issue appears to be within the transaction processing logic related to P025 field validation.  Clarification is needed on the valid values for the P025 field.",

    "analysis": "The issue lies within the WLPFO transaction processing logic, specifically in the validation of the P025 field.  The logs indicate that value 28 is being rejected while 00 is accepted. This suggests either an incorrect validation rule or a misconfiguration within the system.  The development team needs to analyze the WLPFO codebase to identify the faulty logic and correct it.  Testing should include various P025 values to ensure proper validation and processing.",
