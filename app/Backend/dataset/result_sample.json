Transactions with P025 set to '00' are processing successfully, indicating an issue isolated to the handling of the '28' value. The attached transaction logs likely contain specific error messages that will aid in pinpointing the problem within the WLPFO transaction processing logic.

We will also conduct comprehensive testing with various P025 values to determine the acceptable range and ensure the implemented fix addresses the issue completely. We understand the urgency of this matter and will provide updates as we progress towards a resolution."
